excerpt: > #
    Mobify was commissioned by Fox Head Racing to design and develop a mobile experience for their existing e-commerce platform. I designed a system to simplify their navigation and clarify the path for users to purchase items. We implemented a novel method for interacting with product images as well as majorly simplified their checkout process.
